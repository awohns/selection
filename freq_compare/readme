How analyses in this folder work:

Run the following lines to set it all in motion:
module load R
Rscript freq_compare.R targets_and_ref_files_list/targetsandrefs.txt

This will make freq_compare.R run a loop over targetsandfrequencies.txt and at each row of the data table will call sbatch compare_each_chr.R refname targetname

Hierarchy of files:
freq_compare.R
calls
compare_freq_pipeline.sh
which calls
compare_each_chr.R for each iteration
