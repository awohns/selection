withrsids is the final product of these folders
In the "joined" directory within "withrsids" is the list of all the chromosomes with allele frequency and rsids.
gbrvcfs folder has all the Great Britian samples from 1000g project -> I get the allele frequencies using angsd in the allele frequency folder, then I add the rsids back into the file in the withrsids folder. These are used in conjunction with the targets from the other folder in the freq_compare folder where they are merged and analyzed.
